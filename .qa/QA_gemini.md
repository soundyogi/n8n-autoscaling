# QA Assessment Report

## Project Overview

This report summarizes the findings of a quality assurance check performed on the n8n-autoscaling repository. The goal of the assessment was to identify potential security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for mitigation.

## Findings

### 1. Hardcoded Passwords and Secrets

*   **Issue:** The `.env.example` file contains placeholder passwords for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN`. If these are not changed, attackers could potentially gain access to the database, encrypt/decrypt data, or execute unauthorized actions.
*   **Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation:** Ensure that all default passwords and encryption keys in the `.env` file are changed to strong, unique values.
*   **Files Affected:** `.env.example`

### 2. Redis Password Security

*   **Issue:** The `autoscaler/autoscaler.py` and `monitor/monitor_redis_queue.py` scripts connect to Redis using the `REDIS_PASSWORD` environment variable. If Redis is not properly secured with a strong password, attackers could potentially gain access to the Redis server and manipulate the queue.
*   **Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation:** Ensure that Redis is configured with a strong password and that the `REDIS_PASSWORD` environment variable is set accordingly.
*   **Files Affected:** `autoscaler/autoscaler.py`, `monitor/monitor_redis_queue.py`, `docker-compose.yml`

### 3. Cloudflare Token Exposure

*   **Issue:** The `docker-compose.yml` file uses the `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` environment variable to configure Cloudflare. If this token is exposed, attackers could potentially gain control of the Cloudflare tunnel and redirect traffic.
*   **Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation:** Treat the Cloudflare token as a sensitive credential and protect it accordingly. Ensure that it is not exposed in logs or other publicly accessible locations.
*   **Files Affected:** `docker-compose.yml`, `README.md`

### 4. `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL` Configuration

*   **Issue:** The `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL` environment variable in the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` allows specific external modules to be used in n8n functions. If this variable is not carefully configured, attackers could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in these modules to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Carefully review the list of allowed external modules and ensure that only trusted modules are included. Consider restricting the use of external modules altogether if possible.
*   **Files Affected:** `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`

### 5. Docker Socket Exposure

*   **Issue:** The `docker-compose.yml` file mounts the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`) into the `n8n-autoscaler` container. This allows the autoscaler to control the Docker daemon. If the autoscaler is compromised, attackers could potentially use this access to gain control of the entire system.
*   **Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation:** Carefully consider the security implications of mounting the Docker socket into the autoscaler container. If possible, use a less privileged method of scaling the worker containers, such as the Docker API.
*   **Files Affected:** `docker-compose.yml`

### 6. Dependency Vulnerabilities

*   **Issue:** The project may be using vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Scan the project for vulnerable dependencies using a tool like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`. Update any vulnerable dependencies to the latest versions.
*   **Files Affected:** `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `autoscaler/requirements.txt`

### 7. Lack of Input Validation

*   **Issue:** The application may not be properly validating user inputs, which could lead to vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, command injection, or XSS.
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation throughout the application. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Sanitize user inputs before displaying them in the UI to prevent XSS.
*   **Files Affected:** All files that handle user inputs

### 8. Insecure File Uploads

*   **Issue:** The application may allow users to upload files without proper security checks. This could allow attackers to upload malicious files that could compromise the system.
*   **Severity:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Implement strict file upload policies. Validate file types and sizes. Sanitize file names. Store uploaded files in a secure location.
*   **Files Affected:** All files that handle file uploads

## Recommendations

*   Change all default passwords and encryption keys in the `.env` file to strong, unique values.
*   Configure Redis with a strong password and set the `REDIS_PASSWORD` environment variable accordingly.
*   Protect the Cloudflare token as a sensitive credential.
*   Carefully review the list of allowed external modules in the `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL` environment variable.
*   Consider the security implications of mounting the Docker socket into the autoscaler container.
*   Scan the project for vulnerable dependencies and update them to the latest versions.
*   Implement robust input validation throughout the application.
*   Implement strict file upload policies.
